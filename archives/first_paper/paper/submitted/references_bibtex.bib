We then attempt to find solutions to this problem using the IEEE 118-bus and the RTS 96 system test cases. The IEEE 118-bus test case is analyzed at varying load levels. Using simple heuristics, we demonstrate that these networks can be operated to satisfy N-1 standards while cutting costs by incorporating transmission switching into the dispatch. In some cases, the percent savings from transmission switching was higher with an N-1 DCOPF formulation than with a DCOPF formulation.

The MILP OTS model with the proposed connectivity constraints can be readily solved by well-developed MILP solvers.

  abstract = {This paper seeks to improve the computational time needed to solve transmission switching problems. Transmission switching provides an effective way to reduce operating costs in power system operations by altering the topology of the transmission network. However, determining the optimal set of lines to switch creates an enormous computational burden. Transmission switching formulations add binary decision variables for many transmission lines in the system to indicate if they are switched. This creates a very weak formulation that is difficult to solve. Altering the transmission topology by switching lines can affect the reliability of the network, for instance, by creating islands. Additional reliability constraints need to be added to the problem formulation. These constraints can potentially make an already difficult problem even harder. This paper takes a different approach to the transmission switching problem. Rather than preventing islanding by using constraints in the problem formulation, we look at how they can be used to improve the solution process. Specifically, we develop a cutting plane algorithm to generate valid inequalities and fix variables based on the fact that optimal solutions to the transmission switching problem that do not contain islands exist.},
